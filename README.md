# kubernetes-talk
Portuguese apresentation for https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/go-belo-horizonte/events/258201849/

## How to run

I was not able to use github pages since I'm storing it in a private repository and I don't have full plan. So, sadly to see it you will need to clone and open the index:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:voiski/kubernetes-talk.git
open kubernetes-talk/index.html
```
